# Cloud Config Used for user data injection

## Purpose
Create ECS instance on OTC and perform user adding, file provisioning for the instance.

## How to
Add user data with OS::Heat::CloudConfig <br>
```yaml
  server_init:
    type: OS::Heat::CloudConfig
    properties:
      cloud_config:
        write_files:
        - path: /tmp/test
          content: "Hello OTC"
        groups:
          - ugroup
        users:
          - default
          - name: demo
            gecos: demostration user
            primary_group: demo
            groups: users
            sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
            home: /home/demo
            plain_text_passwd: 'demo4otc'
            ssh_redirect_user: true

```

There are also other ways to do this with cloud-init. please refer:<br>

## Note
This feaure is supported by RTS(Resource Template Service) on OTC, and it is based on Openstack Heat. <br>
Since HEAT  was defaulting to HEAT_CFNTOOLS. it is considered legacy and RAW or SOFTWARE_CONFIG will generally be more appropriate.
Dont' forget to specify the data format to RAW or SOFTWARE_CONFIG when using HEAT
